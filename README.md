# Atliq-Telecom-Service-Provider-Revenue-After-5G-Launch
## Problem Statement :
AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched it’s 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. Atliqo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights which would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They also wonder if they can optimize their internet plans to get more active users.

## Approach:

The data provided by AtliQO data team is very cleaned, organized and ready to be analyzed.

Hence the basic approach here was to prepare a data model, create Key performance indicators, Key measures and metrics and visualize the trends, all on Power BI.

## Conclusion:

1. Inactive users add cost to the company and hence they should be terminated with 60 days notice.
2. Focus on customer retention in cities like DELHI, CHENNAI, HYDERABAD, PUNE. Reduce the churn rate by providing excellent customer service and flexible plans.
3. Customers prefer to have high validity as well as per day data usage plans rather than a bundle of data pack. Plans P5, P6 and P7 can be revised keeping this in mind and separate plan can be created for users who prefer low validity and bundle data pack.
4. Plan revenue is better post 5G, however the overall revenue has not seen significant change except the month of June. This could be due to the cost of operating 5G connections, installations, maintaining services, etc.
5. Find new ways to advertise and promote 5G to compete the market share with competitors. BRITEL is the closest competitor and AtliQO should consider to build strategies accordingly.
